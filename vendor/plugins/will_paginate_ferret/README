WillPaginateFerret
==================

Adds a paginate_by_contents method to your ActiveRecord models with the same
API as acts_as_ferret's find_by_contents but with an options hash that accepts
the :page and :per_page parameters, as will_paginate's paginate* methods.

You can use the helper will_paginate() with no change.

Usage (in your controllers):

@posts = Post.paginate_by_contents("search query", :page => params[:page])
